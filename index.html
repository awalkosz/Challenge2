                        Hello and welcome to my Portfolio. I my name is Adrian Walkosz. I am a first generation Polish American. I currently have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Illinois at Chicago. I have had experience in many fields of work including general construction, auto mechanic and detailer and sales. As an engineer I mainly did automation and machine design. I currently am furthering my knowledge in software development as I have always had an interest in coding. I am very excited to learn and develop my skills in the software developement field and progress my career in this ever expanding field.
